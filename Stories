Once upon a time, There were two friends, Harry and Peter walking through the forest. They knew that anything
dangerous can happen to them at any time in the forest.So they promised each other, That they would remain
united in any case of danger. 

Suddenly they saw a large Bear, approaching them. one of the friends at once climbed the near by tree,
but the other one did not know how to climb a tree.So being led by his common senses he laid down on the 
ground breathless pretending to be a dead man

The bear came near the man lying on the ground. sensed his ears and slowly lleft the place, because the bears
do not touch the dead creatures.

Now the friend on the tree came back and asked the other on the ground: "Friend what did the bear tell you
into your ears?" 
The other one replied: "The bear advised me not to beleive a false friend"
